#### Starcraft Simulator v1.0
Ever wondered whether two ghosts kill a maxed out queen? Wonder no more as
this simulator gives you the option of picking two army compositions and
simulating a battle between them. No micro is assumed and the armies engage
in battle by running towards eachother and attacking the first unit that's
within range and vision.
